SIMILARITY OF ITERATOR AND POITER
vector<int>v;                                                                 int a[5]={1,2,3,4,5}
auto it=v.begin() //point to first element of vector                          int *p=a;
//auto is used to detect any data type                                         

cout<<*it //1
*it++;
cout<<*it //2

MORE OR LESS IT IS SAME AS POINTERS
